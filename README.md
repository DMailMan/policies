# Infinity Works - Policies

## Overview

OK, now before you panic about the sheer volume of reading that lays ahead of you we do actually want you to take this a little seriously. As Ron would say “it’s kind of a big deal!”

So grab a cuppa, sit comfortably and start reading.

## Why are we implementing ISO27001?

For one it’ll make sure we don’t get into any unnecessary trouble and perhaps do something accidental that might implicate a person, our company or a client.

Also, by having these policies we will demonstrate to our clients that we take security seriously and won’t let ourselves or them down. Plus, it will unlock more doors to more clients in the future who count on this level of security from us.

So once you’ve read and understood these policies we’d really like you to accept them which you can do by clicking on the link at the very bottom of this page

Sound good? OK let’s get started!!
