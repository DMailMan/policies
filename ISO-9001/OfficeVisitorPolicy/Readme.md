# Office Visitor Policy

When visitors arrive at an Infinity Works office, they need to be registered and made aware of its relevant policies.

## Visitor Registration

Upon arrival at the office, the visitor should be registered by recording their name, organisation, time of arrival, and host for the visit.

This registration may take place at either the building reception or Infinity Works' reception, as determined by the facilities available at each office. The visitor should be told at this time of the emergency assembly location for the office.

Upon leaving the building, the visitor should also sign out.

## Relevant procedures

The visitor must then be made aware of the relevant policies and procedures that they need to follow, copies of which need to be made available. These are:

- [Health and Safety policy](https://policies.infinityworks.com/ISO-9001/HealthAndSafetyAtWorkPolicy/)
- [Office Visitor Privacy policy](https://policies.infinityworks.com/ISO-9001/OfficeVisitorPrivacyPolicy)
- [Office Visitor Confidentiality policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTDKkWvhuOxn9ta0A1NZtUlOfEm8Qon6/view?usp=sharing)
- [Code of Conduct policy](https://policies.infinityworks.com/ISO-9001/code-of-conduct/)

Visitors' private information is controlled by the Office Visitor Privacy policy, a copy of which should be provided upon request.

Visitors' hosts should be reminded that in case of Fire or an emergency evacuation, the Visitor portion of the Infinity Works' Fire and Emergency Evacuation procedure states:

*"Visitors are the responsibility of the employee they are meeting with.*

*All other visitors - whether situated on their own or in a toilet - are the responsibility of the Fire Marshal to guide them to the assembly point. The Fire Marshal will select a member of staff to take them to the assembly point if the host staff member is not nearby."*

Contractors who are visiting to undertake work on Infinity Works' office building or facilities should be taken through a more detailed induction and risk assessment by the local office manager. This can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DVJepDPo4FGmywDyr2laukvvwyznW-51/view?usp=sharing) on the Office and Assets Team Drive.

Further procedures may be needed according to each location. If so, they will be documented on the office-specific portion of the Infintranet [here](https://sites.google.com/infinityworks.com/infinitranet/offices?authuser=1) in the Facilities Handbook, and must be brought to the attention of the visitor by their host or by the office management staff.
