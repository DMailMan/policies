In order to ensure your safety and also the safety of Infinity Works staff and other Visitors we require a database of Visitor’s personal data containing your name, employment details, email address and telephone number and date and time of entry and to and exit from Infinity Works’ office.

To support our clients we need to record the personal data of client contacts and we may use the information obtained from you in order to support our services to the client you were representing during your visit to our offices.

To maintain, expand and develop our business we may use your information to contact you, through various routes such as email, phone, and other relevant notifications.

4. How we share your Personal Information

In addition to the use by our Service Providers as described in section 3 above, where it is necessary for the performance of our duty of care that we owe to you whilst you are on our premises, we may need to share your Personal Information with relevant third parties such as the emergency services or the Landlord of the relevant office.

If our business enters into a joint venture with, purchases or is sold to or merges with another business entity, your Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred to the purchaser, our new business partners or owners or their advisors.
In addition, it may be necessary to disclose your Personal Information if we are under a duty to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal obligation, enforce an agreement, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Infinity Works and our contractors, directors, employees or other personnel. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and prevention.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Information and to treat it in accordance with the law.  We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

We will obtain your express consent, or procure that our Service Providers seek your consent, before we share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes. 

5. Our security and data retention measures, and any transfers we make outside of the EEA

We take steps to protect your Personal Information from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as we reasonably require and, in any event, only for as long as the Data Protection Legislation allows.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and, although we will take steps to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via the Website; any transmission is therefore at your own risk.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 

In processing your Personal Information, it may be necessary for us to transfer your Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (“EEA“). It may also be accessed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy and the Data Protection Legislation when it is processed in, or other accessed from, a location outside the EEA. This means that we will only transfer your Personal Information to third parties outside the EEA if that third party (a) is situated in a country that has been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to Personal Information, or (b) has agreed (by way of written contract) to provide all protections to your Personal Information as required by the Data Protection Legislation.

6. Accessing and updating your Personal Information

You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Information for marketing or research purposes.  We will usually inform you (before collecting your Personal Information) if we intend to use your Personal Information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your Personal Information to any third party for such purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at the details set out at section 9 below, or our Service Providers at the details set out at section 3 above.

You have the right to see the Personal Information we hold about you and to ask us to: (a) make any changes to ensure that any Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and up to date; (b) erase or stop processing any Personal Information we hold about you where there is no longer a legal ground for us to hold it; or (c) transfer any information we hold about you to a specified third party. If you wish to do this, please contact us on SAR@infinityworks.com or for any other information or support please contact us via the contact details in section 9 below.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.  Alternatively we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. 

7. Complaints

Should you have any queries or complaints in relation to how we use your Personal Information, please contact us using the details set out at section 9 below. Should you wish to take any complaints or queries further, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office regarding such issues.
