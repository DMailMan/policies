# Infinity Works Expenses Policy and Receipt Processing

One of the things we’re keen to have in place is an easy, specific, clear expenses policy - one where people raising expenses can understand what they can spend, who approves and validates their expenses claims, and how much they’re going to be paid and by when.

It is extremely important for Infinity Works that we process expenses and receipts quickly to allow us to manage the internal accounts properly and promptly and pay you back as quickly as we can.

Additionally, we have been extremely poor at ensuring that VAT receipts are provided in a timely fashion - this has impacted our ability to reclaim VAT effectively. Ultimately we’d much prefer to spend our money on our team than paying unnecessary VAT!

In order to make sure we do this effectively, we have put this guidance together to underline the process.

## Who validates my expenses claim?
Your Account Lead or a Board Member will approve your expenses claim (with receipts) according to the following spending guidance.

## How do I create a claim?
We have a user guide on the infinitranet (under the employee portal section) to guide you through entering and submitting expenses.

## When and how will I get paid?
All expenses that are approved by the end of the month will be reimbursed no later than the Friday of the week that follows month end.

## What do I need in order for my expense claim to be approved and paid?
In all instances a VAT receipt MUST be provided where possible - exceptions to this will be reviewed on a case by case basis and may be escalated to a member of the Board.

A VAT receipt will include the provider’s VAT number and a breakdown of the cost including VAT. Note that some common expenses, e.g. train fares or take away cold drinks are VAT exempt, and many small traders are not VAT registered. It’s always best to ask for a VAT receipt first and accept a non-VAT receipt if that is all that is available.

There are a number of categories of expenses that you will raise, and here’s guidance on what the Admin team need in order to complete and pay your claim quickly.

**When claiming for expenses when entertaining our clients:**
- VAT receipt
- Tag the customer and project, e.g. Sainsbury’s
- Split of clients vs IW people? (e.g. 50% were client attendees)

**For Staff Entertaining:**
- VAT receipt
- Who was there (if >5 people please provide the team name)
- If there are any attendees that are not IW Staff - this is Client entertaining.

**For Advocacy sessions:**
- VAT receipt
- Who was there?

**For Mileage (to allow us to reclaim VAT):**
- Fuel receipt (doesn’t have to be for that particular journey, but must be within 90 days)
- Diesel or petrol car?
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Put to the 
- Postcode to and from
- How many miles?

**For Travel, e.g. Train, Air, Road (Can be booked by either Principals, Managing Consultants, Account Leads or the central Admin team):**
- Receipt / booking confirmation
- To / From?
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Select the ‘billable’ option in Expensify if it is.

**For Accommodation (though we expect this to be booked via the Admin team in all but emergency circumstances):**
- Receipt / booking confirmation
- Location stayed
- Number of nights
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Select the ‘billable’ option in Expensify if it is.


For Taxis to client sites:
Receipt or booking confirmation
To / From?
Who was there?
Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
Is it rechargeable to the client? Select the ‘billable’ option in Expensify if it is.

_**Please note - travel cannot be claimed from your home to your regular place of business (typically your home IW office)**._

**For Subsistence:**
VAT Receipt
Claim for your own subsistence only.
Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
Is it rechargeable to the client? Allocate the claim to the ‘Expenses to recharge to client - Expensify’ category

## What can I spend?
So we’re clear on what our team can spend (and to allow the people who validate and approve expense claims to approve quickly) we have pulled together the following guidance. Please do your best to keep to these (and the spirit of these) - again, we’d prefer to spend money on things that improve our team and people where possible! 

Obviously with all guidance there is a degree of common sense that needs to be applied, e.g. 
we don’t want you to book a cheap hotel only to spend a fortune on taxis, and we don’t want you walking through dodgy areas to get to a hotel that’s £10 cheaper.

Book things like you would if it was your money, as not to be wasteful whilst taking the same care and consideration for your safety that you would at home.

Whilst we do not skimp on buying appropriate accessories and IT kit, we expect these things (in all but an emergency) to be purchased via the Admin team.
