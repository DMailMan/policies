# Lone Worker Policy

At present, some people can access Infinity Works' office buildings 24-hours a day.

The organisation will generally avoid the need for employees to work alone where reasonably practicable. Where lone working is necessary, the organisation will take all reasonable steps to ensure the health and safety of employees working alone.
The organisation will ensure that a risk assessment is conducted and that arrangements are in place prior to employees working alone.

## Procedure wording
The Local Board and Office Manager will ensure that:
- lone working is avoided as far as is reasonably practicable;
- emergency procedures are in place so that members of staff working alone can obtain assistance if required;
- a risk assessment is completed by a person competent to do so prior to employees working alone;
- any employee working alone is capable of undertaking the work alone;
- arrangements are in place so that someone else is aware of a lone worker's whereabouts at all times;
- persons working alone are provided with adequate information, instruction and training to understand the hazards and risks and the safe working procedures associated with working alone;
- training records are kept; and
- ensure that individuals' personal data, including information about their health, collected during lone working assessments is handled in accordance with the organisation's data protection policy.

### The person conducting the lone working assessment will:
- give consideration to the greater risks to expectant mothers and young persons;
- involve the employee who is working alone in the assessment process and the development of safe working methods;
- advise the employee undertaking the lone working of the findings of the assessment;
- maintain a file of all lone working assessments; and
- ensure that individuals' personal data, including information about their health, collected during lone working assessments is handled in accordance with the organisation's data protection policy on processing special categories of personal data.

### Employees working alone will:
- follow the safe working arrangements developed by the organisation for loneworking (described below);
- take reasonable steps to ensure their own safety; and
- inform their line manager/assessor of any incidents or safety concerns.

When working alone, employees must:
- If the building has security or reception staff in attendance, advise them upon arrival that the staff member will be working alone.
- Using the regional office Slack channel, alert colleagues that they are planning to work alone.
- Send out a Slack alert both when they arrive and when they are departing.
- Where possible, ensure someone outside the office is aware of what time they should be home in case of off-site problems.
