## What is bribery?

“Bribe” means a financial or other inducement or reward for action which is illegal, unethical, a breach of trust or improper in any way.  Bribes can take the form of money, gifts, loans, fees, hospitality, services, discounts, the award of a contract or any other advantage or benefit. “Bribery” includes offering, promising, giving, accepting or seeking a bribe.
All forms of bribery are strictly prohibited.  If you are unsure whether a particular act constitutes bribery, raise it with the [People Team](https://intranet.infinityworks.com/key-people/head-office-support).  
Specifically you must not:
Give or offer any payment, gift, hospitality or other benefit in the expectation that a business advantage will be received in return, or to reward any business received;
Accept any offer from a third party that you know or suspect is made with the expectation that we will provide a business advantage for them or anyone else;
Give or offer any payment (sometimes called a facilitation payment) to a government official in any country to facilitate or speed up a routine or necessary procedure.
You must not threaten or retaliate against another person who has refused to offer or accept a bribe or who has raised concerns about possible bribery or corruption.
