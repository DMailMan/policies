Infinity Works have a Baseline SDLC for our 'in-life' projects.  This is adapted accordingly depending on individual Client's needs.

The baseline SDLC for 'in-life projects' can be viewed in our [Quality Manual](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/117wlPCx-NSRgb3Togo41r1SrYbVyiOmb)
from page 53 onwards. 

More insight, examples and "How To" guides are provided on our [Intranet](https://sites.google.com/infinityworks.com/infinitranet/infinity-works/our-business/our-delivery-approach)
