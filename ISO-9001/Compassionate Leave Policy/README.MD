# Compassionate Leave Policy

## About this Policy

Compassionate leave is designed to help our employees cope with the death of a close relative, deal
with necessary arrangements and attend their funeral. It may also be granted where a close
relative is seriously or critically ill.

This policy does not form part of your contract of employment and we may
amend it at any time.

## Entitlement

You are entitled to take paid compassionate leave of up to 28 days in any 12-
month period in respect of a spouse or partner, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, step-
parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, brother or sister, stepbrother or stepsister, or brother
or sister-in-law.

We may exercise our discretion to grant a period of paid compassionate leave in respect
of any other relative or close friend, depending on the circumstances of each case.

If you are still unable to return to work following an authorised period of compassionate
leave you should contact your Manager. It may be appropriate to take a period of annual leave, subject to your
managerâ€™s approval, or we may at our discretion grant you further unpaid leave in those
circumstances.

## Requesting Passionate Leave

We recognise that it may not always be possible to request compassionate leave in
advance. However, where it is possible, you should make a request to your Manager. You should tell them the reasons for your request and the number of days
leave you would like to take.

3.2. Where it is not possible to request leave in advance, you should contact your manager as soon as possible to tell them the reason for your absence and the
number of days you expect to be absent. If necessary, your Advocate or another colleague can do this on your behalf.
