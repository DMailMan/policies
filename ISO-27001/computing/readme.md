# Computing Policy

##	Overview

Allowing employees to install software on company computing devices is a risk which needs to be managed. Risks include dependency conflicts which prevent programs from running, the introduction of malware and the use of unlicensed software. As a technology consultancy and inline with our culture, we allow the employee to take responsibility for ensuring compliance with this policy. However, we also reserve the right to restrict this for cases we feel is appropriate.

## Purpose

To outline the requirements around installation software on company owned computing devices and to minimise the risk of loss of program functionality, the exposure of sensitive information contained within Infinity Works' computing network, the risk of introducing malware, and the legal exposure of running unlicensed software.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Infinity Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents with an Infinity Works-owned device. This policy covers all computers, servers, smartphones, tablets and other computing devices operating within Infinity Works.

## Policy

- Employees may install software on computing devices operated within the Infinity Works network in order to perform their role / function.
- All software must be appropriately licensed either by Infinity Works or by the user.
- All users must take every measure to ensure that they do not inject malware onto Infinity Works systems and networks.
- The Administration Team will obtain and track licenses owned by Infinity Works.
- Infinity Works computational devices may be audited at any time.
