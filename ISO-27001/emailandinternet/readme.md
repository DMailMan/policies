# Email and Internet Policy

## Overview

Electronic email is pervasively used in almost all industry verticals and is often the primary communication and awareness method within an organization. At the same time, misuse of email can pose many legal, privacy and security risks, therefore it’s important for users to understand the appropriate use of electronic communications. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this email policy is to ensure the proper use of the Infinity Works email system and make users aware of what Infinity Works deems as acceptable and unacceptable use of its email system. This policy outlines the minimum requirements for use of email within the Infinity Works Network. 

## Scope

This policy covers appropriate use of any email sent from a Infinity Works email address and applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, and agents operating on behalf of Infinity Works.

## Policy

All use of email must be consistent with Infinity Works policies and procedures of ethical conduct, safety, compliance with applicable laws and proper business practices. All email usage must also abide by the policy set out in the [Data Transfer Policy](../datatransfer/readme.md).

All Infinity Works data contained within an email message or an attachment must be secured according to the Data Protection Policy.

Email should be retained only if it qualifies as a Infinity Works business record. Email is an Infinity Works business record if there exists a legitimate and ongoing business reason to preserve the information contained in the email.

Users are prohibited from using third-party email systems and storage servers, with the exception of Google Apps for Business, to conduct Infinity Works business, to create or memorialize any binding transactions, or to store or retain email on behalf of Infinity Works.  Such communications and transactions should be conducted through proper channels using Infinity Works Consulting-approved documentation. 

Using a reasonable amount of Infinity Works resources for personal emails is acceptable, but non-work related email shall be saved in a separate folder from work related email.  Sending chain letters or joke emails from a Infinity Works email account is prohibited.
