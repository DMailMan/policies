# Remote Access and Mobile Policy

## Overview
Remote access to our corporate network is essential to maintain our Team’s productivity, but in many cases this remote access originates from networks that may already be compromised or are at a significantly lower security posture than our corporate network.  While these remote networks are beyond the control of Infinity Works policy, we must mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define rules and requirements for connecting to Infinity Works network from any host. These rules and requirements are designed to minimize the potential exposure to Infinity Works from damages which may result from unauthorized use of Infinity Works resources. Damages include the loss of sensitive or company confidential data, intellectual property, damage to public image, damage to critical Infinity Works internal systems, and fines or other financial liabilities incurred as a result of those losses.

## Scope
This policy applies to all Infinity Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents with a Infinity Works owned or personally-owned computer or workstation used to connect to the Infinity Works network. This policy applies to remote access connections used to do work on behalf of Infinity Works, including reading or sending email and viewing intranet web resources.  This policy covers any and all technical implementations of remote access used to connect to Infinity Works networks.

## Policy
It is the responsibility of Infinity Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents with remote access privileges to Infinity Works corporate network to ensure that their remote access connection is given the same consideration as the user's on-site connection to Infinity Works. 

General access to the Internet for recreational use through the Infinity Works network is strictly limited to Infinity Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents (hereafter referred to as “Authorized Users”).  When accessing the Infinity Works network from a personal computer, Authorized Users are responsible for preventing access to any Infinity Works computer resources or data by non-Authorized Users.  Performance of illegal activities through the Infinity Works network by any user (Authorized or otherwise) is prohibited.  The Authorized User bears responsibility for and consequences of misuse of the Authorized User’s access.  For further information and definitions, see the Acceptable Use Policy.

Authorized Users will not use Infinity Works networks to access the Internet for outside business interests.

For additional information regarding Infinity Works remote access connection options, including how to obtain a remote access login, free anti-virus software, troubleshooting, etc., speak to a representative of the ISMS Committee. 
             
### Requirements 
Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and strong pass-phrases. For further information see the Acceptable Encryption Policy and the Password Policy. 
Authorized Users shall protect their login and password, even from family members. 
While using a Infinity Works owned computer to remotely connect to Infinity Works corporate network, Authorized Users shall ensure the remote host is not connected to any other network at the same time, with the exception of personal networks that are under their complete control or under the complete control of an Authorized User or Third Party. 
Use of external resources to conduct Infinity Works business must be approved in advance by ISMS Committee.
All hosts that are connected to Infinity Works internal networks via remote access technologies must use the most up-to-date anti-virus software (place url to corporate software site here), this includes personal computers. Third party connections must comply with requirements as stated in the Third Party Agreement. 
Personal equipment used to connect to Infinity Works networks must meet the requirements of Infinity Works owned equipment for remote access as stated in the Hardware and Software Configuration Standards for Remote Access to Infinity Works Networks.
